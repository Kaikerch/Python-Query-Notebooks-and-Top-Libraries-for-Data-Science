# Python Query Notebooks and Top Libraries for Data Science
 
 > Status: Concluded
 
 In this project, in Google Colaboratory and Jupyter, I created consultation notebooks to help me use data science algorithms in Python in my future projects, in addition to making them available to the community in order to help those who were starting. The notebooks range from programming logic with the Python language to the use of libraries such as numpy and pandas for data processing.
